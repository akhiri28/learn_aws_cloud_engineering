Great choice! Here’s how we can structure your project:

### **🚀 Project: Real-Time Data Pipeline with Quality Monitoring & Email Alerts**  

#### **📌 Overview**  
This project will build an **end-to-end ETL pipeline** that:  
1. **Ingests real-time data** (e.g., stock prices, weather, IoT sensor data).  
2. **Processes and stores the data** in a cloud-based warehouse.  
3. **Monitors data quality** (checking for anomalies, missing values, or outliers).  
4. **Sends automated email alerts** if quality issues are detected.

### **🛠️ Tech Stack**  
- **Ingestion**: Python, Kafka/Kinesis (for real-time data streaming)  
- **Processing & Storage**: AWS Lambda, S3, Redshift/Snowflake/PostgreSQL  
- **Quality Monitoring**: Python, SQL, Great Expectations  
- **Email Notifications**: AWS SES, SendGrid, or SMTP (Gmail API)  
- **Orchestration**: Apache Airflow (to schedule and monitor ETL tasks)

### **🗂️ Project Architecture**  

1️⃣ **Real-Time Data Ingestion**  
- Connect to an API or data source (e.g., stock market API, IoT sensors).  
- Stream data using **Kafka** or **AWS Kinesis**.  
- Store raw data in **S3 or a staging database**.  

2️⃣ **ETL Processing & Data Transformation**  
- Convert raw data into a structured format (CSV/JSON → SQL tables).  
- Store cleaned data in **Redshift/Snowflake/PostgreSQL**.  

3️⃣ **Data Quality Monitoring**  
- Run **data validation checks** using **Great Expectations**.  
- Detect missing values, duplicates, or outliers.  

4️⃣ **Email Alert System**  
- If a data quality issue is found, trigger an **email alert** to stakeholders.  
- Use **AWS SES, SendGrid, or SMTP** to send emails.  
- Attach a summary report of the issue.  

5️⃣ **Dashboard & Reporting (Optional)**  
- Build a **Streamlit/Dash** dashboard to visualize real-time data trends and quality status.

### **📬 Example Email Alert**  

**Subject:** 🚨 Data Quality Alert – Missing Values Detected!  

**Body:**  
"Hello,  
We detected **5 missing records** in the latest stock price dataset. Please review the attached report for details.  

Best,  
Automated ETL Monitoring System"  

(Attach a CSV or PDF summary)

### **✨ Why This Project Stands Out**  
✅ **End-to-End Data Engineering** – Covers ingestion, processing, storage, and monitoring.  
✅ **Real-Time Analytics** – Showcases skills in handling live data streams.  
✅ **Automated Monitoring & Alerts** – Demonstrates proactive data management.  
✅ **Cloud & Scalability** – Uses AWS services for a production-like setup.
