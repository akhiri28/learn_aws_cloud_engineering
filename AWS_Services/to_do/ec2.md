What is EC2?
------------

    - EC2 - Elastic Compute Capacity, is service provided by AWS to build on-demand, secure, scalable, reliable (consistent and correct) compute capacity in AWS with commitment of 99.9% availability (always accessible). Using Ec2, as many Virtual Machines as required can be spinned easily and quickly. The storage, network and security can be configured manually.

    - (Optional) - Explore in perspective of security - AWS Nitro System. 

    - EC2 Instance is a virtual serer in AWS cloud. 

What are Feature of EC2?
------------------------

    - Features of Ec2
        - Instances - Virtual Server on AWS Cloud.
        - Amazon Machine Images (AMI) - Packged OS and Other software required for Instance.
        - Instance Types - Instance type determines the type of compute (CPU / GPU), memory, network and storage.
        - EBS Volumes - Elastic Block Store 
            - It provides persistant storage to EC2 instance to store the OS, Application Files, Logs and other things etc.
        - Instance store 
            - If EBS volume is not available, EC2 uses temporary storage called, Instance store. Instance store is small storage from the physical machine of data center. The Instance store is lost as soon as the instance is stopped / terminated or hardware fails.
            - (Optional) It is Network Attached Storage (NAS) in Cloud. NAS is storage connected to a network which can be accessed by many devices in the network.
        - Key pairs - Secure login to the EC2 instance - Public key is stored in AWS and private key in store near user.
        - Security groups - A virtual firewall that provide range of IP address, ports and protocols that can be used to access the instance and IP address of the destination which can be access by instance.
        - Instance States
            - running
            - pending
            - stopping
            - stopped
            - shuting down
            - terminated
        - Pricing model for EC2
            - On-demand - Pay by the second/hour. No commitment. - Instance may not be available, a rare case though. - Use Case - Short-term or unpredictable workloads - Development and Testing, Ad-Hoc Data Analytics.
            - Reserved - Commit to 1 or 3 years for a discount (up to ~75%). - Use case - Steady, always-on workloads - Web Servers for Production Websites, Databases (e.g., RDS or EC2-based), Data Warehousing.
            - Spot Instances - Use spare capacity at huge discount (up to 90% off) - High Risk as AWS can take back the instance with 2 hours notice. - Use Case - Flexible, fault-tolerant jobs - Serverless Functions (e.g., AWS Lambda), Data Processing with Auto-scaling.

Use Cases of EC2?
------------------

- Deliver secure, reliable, high-performance, and cost-effective compute infrastructure to meet demanding business needs.
- Access the on-demand infrastructure and capacity you need to run 'HPC applications' faster and cost-effectively. (HPC Apps)
- Access environments in minutes, dynamically scale capacity as needed, and benefit from AWSâ€™s pay-as-you-go pricing. (cost, easily, quick, scale)
- Deliver the broadest choice of compute, networking (up to 400 Gbps), and storage services purpose-built to optimize price performance for ML projects (ML, Cpst)

- Keywords - secure, reliable, high-performance, cost, easily, quick, scale, HPC Apps, ML


How to Use EC2?
---------------
- Launch EC2
- Configure Instance - (Instance Type, Network Settings, Storage, security groups, key pairs).
- Accessing and troubleshooting using SSH (Secure Shell).
- Monitor instance performance and utilization.
