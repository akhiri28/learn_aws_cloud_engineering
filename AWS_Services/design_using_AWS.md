11. Implement a content moderation system that automatically processes and
moderates user-generated content uploaded to S3, using Amazon Rekognition for
image and video moderation, and Lambda for text moderation. Use Step Functions to
orchestrate the moderation workflow and DynamoDB to track moderation status.

12. Design a scalable web crawling system that dynamically allocates resources based
on the queue of URLs to be crawled. Use SQS for URL queue management, Lambda
for executing crawl tasks, and Step Functions to orchestrate scaling decisions and
processing flows.
